      <h6>BORDER</h6>
    <p class="mbp">
      Ok lets start with the border here are some picturess of the different types of borders
      which you can manipulate to your will "did you like that i bet yah did". Anyway to put 
      it in simple terms its like the border dividing the states from mexico and 
      surrounding countries.
      For you tech savy people.
      The CSS border property defines the width, line style, 
      and color of the border of a box. It is a shorthand property 
      for setting the border-width, border-style, and border-color CSS properties.

      <h6>Margin</h6>
      <p class="mbp" >
        Now we move on to margin which effects the suroundings 
        of the border. Where you can pull other content closer or push them away.
        technical term would be!.
        The margin properties are used to create space around elements, 
        outside of any defined borders. With CSS, you have full control over the margins. 
        There are properties for setting the margin for each side of an element 
        (top, right, bottom, and left).

      <h6>Padding</h6>
      <p class="mbp" >
        Now last but not least is padding,
        The padding property in CSS defines the innermost portion of the box model, 
        creating space around an element's content, inside of any defined 
        margins and/or borders. Padding values are set using lengths or percentages, 
        and cannot accept negative values. The initial, or default, value for all padding 
        properties is 0
