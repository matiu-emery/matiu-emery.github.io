    What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
   </h3>
   <p>
      Three things i have learnt about myself
      <li>
        1. Knowing one has the potenial to further grow as a person no only in body,soul and mind but that the brain is forever growing and expanding so the protenial to learn things with the not yet method is exciting.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        2. I am more incline to ask for help rather then trying to do it myself and putting on a brave face also that i enjoy doing medation.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        3. If i fell frustrated a simple walk or even just walking away from the computer for a moment can help me improve my thinking.
      </li>
   </p>

    What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
   </h3>
    <li>
      Values shape our behavior and influence the choices we make, including what we choose to learn and how we approach learning. In programming, values can impact the types of projects we work on, the technologies we use, and the ethical considerations we take into account when designing systems.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Empathy helps us understand the perspectives and experiences of others, which can be valuable in learning and programming. In learning, empathy allows us to better understand the perspectives of our teachers and classmates, which can improve our ability to work in a team and collaborate effectively. In programming, empathy can help us design user-centered systems that meet the needs and expectations of the people who will be using them.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Self-awareness is the ability to understand our own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and how they impact others. In learning, self-awareness can help us identify areas where we need to improve and understand our own learning style. In programming, self-awareness can help us understand our own strengths and weaknesses as a programmer, and work to continuously improve our skills and abilities.
    </li>

    What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
   </h3>
   <p>
    What has surprised me most would be the whole concept of core. I am a quiet closed off individual so learning to open up has been a pleasent experience for me, 
   </p>

   <h3 id="path2">
    What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
   </h3>
   <p>
    As stated above this has also been challenging for me. The whole of letting people in has been a struggle. When I first hurt my back and was off work for 6 months kinda changed me from who I was very outgoing and able to chat with anyone to someone being stuck at home and not socializing anxiety built up then covid hit and being forced to practice social distancing.
   </p>

   <h3 id="path2">
    Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
   </h3>
   <p>
    What I have noticed for the reason behind the strong focus on core is to insure the students don't only get the knowledge of programming but also are able to work together with others and have a better social experience also the lack of EQ in this modern age I can see why human skills play a big part in this course also to help our chances of getting a job as a lot of employers are looking for someone with more than just good grades but someone who will fit into their working environment.
   </p>

   <h3 id="path2">
    Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
   </h3>
   <p>
    I would rather focus more on the programming side so I had more time to learn but I do understand why the core is important and why it is needed. In conclusion, there is no argument for me to be against it, and the benefits far out way the arguments one could have.
