      Emotional Intelligence, commonly referred to as EQ, 
      is the ability to recognize, understand, and manage 
      one's own emotions and the emotions of others. 
      It involves the ability to perceive emotions, 
      to access and generate emotions so as to assist thought, 
      to understand emotions and emotional knowledge, 
      and to reflectively regulate emotions so as to promote emotional 
      and intellectual growth.

      IQ, or Intelligence Quotient, is a measure of cognitive abilities and potential.
      It is determined by a standardized test that assesses abilities such as reasoning,
      problem-solving, and memory. IQ is often used as an indicator of academic 
      and professional success.
