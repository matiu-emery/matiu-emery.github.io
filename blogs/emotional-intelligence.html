    <h2 id="title">What is Emotional intelligence?</h2>

    <P id="Emotion">
      Emotional Intelligence, commonly referred to as EQ, 
      is the ability to recognize, understand, and manage 
      one's own emotions and the emotions of others. 
      It involves the ability to perceive emotions, 
      to access and generate emotions so as to assist thought, 
      to understand emotions and emotional knowledge, 
      and to reflectively regulate emotions so as to promote emotional 
      and intellectual growth. <br>
      <br>
      EQ is important because it enables individuals to understand and manage their own 
      emotions, as well as the emotions of others. This allows them to communicate 
      effectively, build strong relationships, and make sound decisions. 
      EQ also plays a crucial role in leadership and teamwork, as it helps individuals 
      to motivate and inspire others, resolve conflicts, and create a positive work 
      environment.

    <h2 id="title">What is intelligence quotient?</h2>

    <p id="quo">
      IQ, or Intelligence Quotient, is a measure of cognitive abilities and potential.
      It is determined by a standardized test that assesses abilities such as reasoning,
      problem-solving, and memory. IQ is often used as an indicator of academic 
      and professional success.

  <section id="compare">

    <h2 id="title">What is the difference?</h2>

    <p id="com">
      The difference between EQ and IQ is that EQ is a measure of emotional intelligence,
      while IQ is a measure of cognitive intelligence. Emotional intelligence refers 
      to the ability to recognize, understand, and manage one's own emotions and the 
      emotions of others. It includes skills such as empathy, self-awareness, 
      and self-regulation. IQ, on the other hand, is a measure of cognitive abilities 
      and potential, such as reasoning, problem-solving, and memory.
    </p>

    <h2 id="title">Conclusion</h2>
    
    <p id="com">
      In my personal life, having a strong EQ allows me to navigate relationships, 
      both personal and professional, with greater ease and understanding. 
      It also helps me to regulate my own emotions, which in turn helps me to make better decisions. 
      In my professional life, having a strong EQ allows me to better connect 
      with my colleagues and clients,
      to lead more effectively, and to create a more positive work environment.

      To practice mindfulness, one can engage in daily meditation or deep breathing exercises.
      One can also focus on being present in the moment, rather than dwelling on the past or worrying 
      about the future. Mindfulness can also be practiced through activities such as yoga or tai chi.
      
      Conscious listening involves actively paying attention to what the other person is saying and making an effort 
      to understand their perspective. This can be practiced by making eye contact, avoiding interruptions,
      and asking clarifying questions. It also involves being present in the moment and not allowing distractions 
      to interfere with the conversation. Practicing conscious listening can improve communication and understanding 
      in relationships and can lead to more successful outcomes in professional settings.
