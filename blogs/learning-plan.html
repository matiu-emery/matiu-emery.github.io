          What I am hoping to get out of this course is the knowledge and skills needed to be able to fit into this industry and bring the best of myself to it
          I would like and plan to start off at a junior level and make my way up as I develop my skills. Making games would be somewhere I would like to end up if not then get a job where they change people's lives for the better.
          Ideally a place with good vibes üòÅüòÜ because I don't tolerate bullshit haha.

            It is my belief that the strengths I wrote in my Foundations are still relevant, and my passion for this has grown during these past weeks.

          <br>!limitations!<br>
          <br>
          <li>
            Still having issues reaching out for help but it is improving and will further improve as BC seems like I will need all the help I can get
            On another note, my communication can do with some work.

          What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
        </h3>
        <p id="plan">
          For me sticking to the goals I've set and not putting too much pressure on myself.
          Like one great lady said if you start to go too fast that's when you need to slow down, sometimes taking it slow can make you jump ahead faster rather than trying to push too fast and get nowhere as you end up going backward.

        <h3 id="path">
          What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h3>
        <p id="plan">
          To further develop my communication skills so I can relate with whoever I meet and also better my EQ for my future endeavors.
          Develop my typing skills to a better standard.
          Develop as a person in general. I believe one can always change no one is set in stone so that pretty much sums it up.

          What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
        </h3>
        <p id="plan">
          In general, effective support, knowledge sharing, empathetic, Push me as a proggramer but also help me grown.

        <h3 id="path">
          What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
        </h3>
        <p id="plan">
          My expectations for boot camp would consist of being patient with myself. Get the help from my peers and facilitators if I'm stuck on a problem for too long by doing this I will set time limits or stick to task boxes. as stated in my foundation blog I will continue to take breaks  and continue working out so my mind, as well as my body,  are both in Optimum  condition to be able to handle the pressures of boot camp.
