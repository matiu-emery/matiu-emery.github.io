      Kia ora koutou, ko Matiu taku ingoa. I live in Kirikiriroa (Hamilton)
      with my little whānau. My nickname is Much and I grew up in Onehunga,
      a suburb of Tāmaki (Auckland) with my mum, 5 siblings and grandfather.
    </p>

    <p class="whoam">
      On my mums side im from Muaūpoko, Ngāti Kahungunu ki Wairarapa, 
      Te Whakatōhea, Ngāi Tai, Ngāi Tūhoe & Ngāti Apakura. On my dads 
      side im from Waikato, Ngāti Maniapoto & Ngāti Apakura. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="whoam">
      People would say that I am polite, caring and very talkative. My key values would be 
      whanaungatanga (kinship), kaitiakitanga (guardianship) and maanakitanga( being supportive).
    </p>
    
    <p class="whoam"> 
      Throughout my adult life, I worked as a Glazier and Truck Driver. 
      However, in 2021, I suffered an injury at work that required surgery. The following year, 
      another injury led to a meeting with a specialist, who advised me that I needed a career 
      change as my back couldn't handle the physical demands of my job. As I considered my options 
      for a new challenge, my partner suggested I look into Dev Academy. I decided to pursue it because
      I enjoy computers and the technical side of things to get a better understanding on how things work.
      I want to improve my skills and it will benefit the future of not only myself but also my whānau. Nga mihi
