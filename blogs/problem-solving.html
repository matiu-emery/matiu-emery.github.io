    <h3 class="path">Blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
    <p id="code">
      Where to start, javascript as a whole has been a tedious journey for me, feeling like a lost puppy in a world of vicious cats, Web3school and MDN made me feel incapable at times but also beneficial as it ended up helping me a lot.
      So the simple problem i ran into was kata manipulating-objects, tyring to link terra to adam and then adam to his children a simple easy task but for some reason i couldn't remember how to link the two sitting there trying to pull the memory of linking the objects as i know i've seen this done many time so what and why can't remeber. After a hour i gave up trying to remember so i done some research and <span>"BOOM"</span> in a second i had found what i had desperately tried to remeber, I learnt through this proccess that if you are stuck even for a moment its better to put that research hat on and just get it done. below is the exsample.
    </p>

<div class="code-wrap"><pre><code>

 let terah = {
  name: 'Terah',
 age: 32,
 height: 172,
 hairColor: 'brown',
  eyeColor: 'brown',
 }

 let adam = {
 name: 'Adam',
 spouse: terah,
 }

 terah.children = {
  ben: { name: 'Ben' },
  wilson: { name: 'Wilson' },
  felicia: { name: 'Felicia' },
}

 //Above is the code i had trouble linking.
 //Below is the code i used to pass the test üòµ‚Äçüí´ ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

 terah.spouse = adam

 adam.children = terah.children
</code></pre></div>

<h3 class="path">Elegantly solved a problem</h3>
<p id="code">
  Ok this was a fun one cause it took me less than 20min it was gradebook 7 stretch material I was gonna attempt it but now I'm glad I did. I solved it with a simple skim through the suite I found the answer well I thought I did, 
  the problem was I was lost from the beginning reading over the question for 10min straight trying to indent it into my head and make sense of the question, so I broke the question down into sections so I could grab what I needed. I felt confident at first then that disappeared quickly as the code became bigger and bigger and it started to overwhelm me, so I decided to break that code down and start deleting parts that I could see were pointless in this situation. I learnt my understanding of reading code is better then i thought in saying that i am still a long ways away.
  here is another exsample
</p>

<div class="code-wrap"><pre><code>
  //This is what i ended up with//

function enterScores(gradebook, students, scores) {
  for (let i = 0; i < students.length; i++) {
    gradebook[students[i]] = {}
    gradebook[students[i]]['testScores'] = scores[i]
  }
}
//.And this is what i started with.//
//.After i started breaking down the code i realized
that the for loop should work as gradebook,students,scores
were already part of the function and sure enough it worked.
In conclusion I still need to better understand 
what im doing so practice practice practice is key. //

function enterScores(gradebook, students, scores){
  gradebook = {};

  const students = ['Joseph', 'Naomi', 'Yosan', 'David'];

  const scores = [
  //Joseph's score
  [80, 70, 70, 100],
  // Naomi's score
  [85, 80, 90, 90],
  // Yosan's score
  [75, 70, 80, 75],
  //Davids's score
  [100, 90, 95, 85],
  ];

for (let i = 0; i < students.length; i++) {
  gradebook[students[i]] = {}
  gradebook[students[i]]['testScores'] = scores[i]
  }  
};
</code></div>

  Reflect on how confident i feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:
</h3>

<ul>
  <li id="processes">Pseudocode</li>
  <p id="code">
    After researching this i am pretty confident i'll be able to better use this in the coming week, for me making it simple sometimes doesnt work as planned but after i practice more im sure i'll get better.
  </p>

  <li id="processes">Trying something</li>
  <p id="code">
    For java not yet as i dont have the tools or fully understand it to try something i did try once but got lost and went back to what i did know. 
  </p>

  <li id="processes">Rubber ducky method</li>
  <p id="code">
    The rubber ducky technique is a clever way to better understand what the issue is and in some instance helps solve a problem, sometime if i repeat something in my mind i also have other thoughts going through, this can cause one i get lost in the abyss so by implementing the rubber ducky method can help focus your thoughts.
  </p>

  <li id="processes">Reading error messages</li>
  <p id="code">
    Of what i can read from error codes it is a helpful tool to have helps pin point where your code is failing.
  </p>

  <li id="processes">Console.logging</li>
  <p id="code">
    I'm a huge believer of Console.log with out it,with out it then coding would be like driving with out eyes lol. 
  </p>

  <li id="processes">Googling</li>
  <p id="code">
    Google is the place to go if your running into problems as you can find anything and everthing needed to help you on your ventures
  </p>

  <li id="processes">Asking your peers for help</li>
  <p id="code">
    Most of the time since i'm mostly behind most in the cohort the questions i wanted to ask have been asked already so in a way they help me more then they no. 
  </p>

  <li id="processes">Asking coaches for help</li>
  <p id="code">
    Again as stated above the coaches are helpful, and with the foundation workshop videos they do answers most question i have.
    i should reach out more though picking there brains would be fun plus they would have many different ways of tackling task.
  </p>

  <li id="processes">Improving your process with reflection</li>
  <p id="code">
    I reflect throughout the day even when exercising my body, it helps me run through what i learnt how i learnt and what can i do to help me think more like a programmer
    and better my learning practice.
  </p>
  
</ul>
