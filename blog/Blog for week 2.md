 One job i was working on as a leading hand had a group which were happy to work together but this one individual had issues with me leading the team and always tried to over write my instruction due to him being older then me, so i had to pull him to the side to explain the sistuation and reasons i was leading hand and and what i could do to get him to co-operate which i ended making him lead of a group to give him some authority which ended up making him a team player. other strategies i would try would to have more group meetings getting feed back and making sure everyones ideas were heard and discuss.
