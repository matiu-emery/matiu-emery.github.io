  <p class="core"> 
    Over the course of my life, I have had to make many ethical decisions.
    As a result of my life experiences, I never sought help for what I was going through
    "I am a man, I do not need anyone's help.I then had children. 
    As a result of trauma I've experienced, I've never been in a good mental space
    As a youngster, I was always firey, short-tempered, and angry. Let me be clear,
    I was Kind and respectful, but if pushed or had a bad day, then that was i
    Chaos ensues. As i got older i started hanging with the wrong crew drugs,alchol,
    fighting.on one night at a party the crew i had hung with were there acting a fool as always,
    when they approached a dude and his girlfriend freghting to beat him up if she didnt chill
    with them. by this time i had changed the people i hung with better people. i was weighed up
    with the choice to interfeen or walk away like i didnt see it. i dicided to interfeen
    as if it was me in there shoe i would want someone to help me.
     So me being me i got the two away from them and started fighting all of them.
    i was lucky i had my cousin and my best mate to asist as we made short work of them.
    after the chaos the two approached me thanking me for stepping in to help them.
    i reflect on this alot im happy i made the choice to help as they became friends i have
    to this day.

  <P class="core">
    My culture is family oriented,being raised by a single parent was tough on my mum
    having 6 of us. fortunally we had our koro with us which he took the role as a father figure
    we didnt have much but we always had food clean clothes and a roof over our heads, 
    we were taught to be respectful, patient, kind, caring, helpfull, to have pride in our culture
    to help those in need and work hard which influenced me alot,even with the traumai had 
    we always travelled to the east coast to be around whanau which we were always greatful 
    for.

      One job i was working on as a leading hand had a group which 
      were happy to work together but this one individual had issues with me 
      leading the team and always tried to over write my instruction due to 
      him being older then me, so i had to pull him to the side to explain the 
      sistuation and reasons i was leading hand and and what i could do to get 
      him to co-operate which i ended making him lead of a group to give him some 
      authority which ended up making him a team player. other strategies i would try 
      would to have more group meetings getting feed back and making sure everyones 
      ideas were heard and discuss.
