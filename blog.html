      One job i was working on as a leading hand had a group which 
      were happy to work together but this one individual had issues with me 
      leading the team and always tried to over write my instruction due to 
      him being older then me, so i had to pull him to the side to explain the 
      sistuation and reasons i was leading hand and and what i could do to get 
      him to co-operate which i ended making him lead of a group to give him some 
      authority which ended up making him a team player. other strategies i would try 
      would to have more group meetings getting feed back and making sure everyones 
      ideas were heard and discuss.
