    <h3>who am I?</h3>
    <p>
      Kia ora koutou ko Matiu toku ingoa, whanau and Friends call me "much".
      ko waikoto me Ngaati Maniapoto nga iwi.
      I grew up in Onehunga, i live in Kirikiriroa(Hamilton).
      key values for me would be whanaungatanga(kinsship), Kaitiakitanga (guardianship), 
      Maanakitanga( being supportive). 
      In 2021, I had an injury at work that required surgery. The following year,
      another injury led to a meeting with a specialist,
      who advised me that I needed to change careers as my back couldn't handle the physical demands of my job. 
      As I considered my options for a new challenge, a family member suggested I look into Dev Academy. 
      I decided to pursue it because I enjoy playing games, I want to improve my skills, and it could benefit my family's future.
      Nga mihi koutou
      </p>
